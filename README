This repository contains a vector version of MIT campus map. This map is based
on the map published by MIT Department of Facilities. The version here is
up-to-date as of July 1, 2013. It is not a complete map; some fragments are
truncated and a lot of details are omitted.

This map is based on MIT Department of Facilities map, and as such,
the copyright to this map belongs to MIT. All of the work which went into
the creation of this version of the map, shall such work be found copyrightable,
is hereby released into public domain.

I have tried to make this map accurate, but it may contain some typos and
incorrect markings. It may also warrant some improvements; note, however, that
I want to keep the map uncluttered with too much excessive detail (which is
one of the motivations for redoing the original map). Patches are welcome,
as long as you agree to release your changes to public domain too.
